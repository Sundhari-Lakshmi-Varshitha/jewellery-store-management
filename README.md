# Project Title: jewellery store management
 – Elevating Jewelry Retail with Smart Customer Engagement

## Problem Statement

Jewelry stores like Golden Era Enterprises face challenges in managing customer relationships, tracking sales, and offering personalized services. Customers often do not receive timely updates on new collections, exclusive offers, or important services such as repairs and maintenance. Sales staff may not have access to complete customer profiles or purchase history, making it difficult to deliver personalized recommendations or upsell effectively. Inventory tracking and post-sale services like resizing or repair updates are often handled manually, resulting in inefficiencies and delays. There is no single system that connects customer preferences, sales data, inventory, and marketing efforts—making it harder to deliver a seamless and memorable shopping experience.

## Proposed Salesforce Solution

- Customers create profiles with their preferences, past purchases, anniversaries, and style interests.
- Sales team records interactions and purchase history directly in the CRM.
- Salesforce sends automated notifications to customers about:
  - New arrivals  
  - Personalized offers  
  - Service reminders (e.g., maintenance, cleaning, or repair updates)
- Inventory is tracked in real-time, showing availability across collections and categories.
- Appointments for in-store visits or virtual consultations can be scheduled and tracked inside Salesforce.
- Dashboards provide real-time insights to store managers showing:
  - Top-selling products and collections  
  - Customer buying trends  
  - Inventory levels and reorder alerts  
  - Customer engagement and service history
